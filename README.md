# Banker-s-Algo

### Introduction

Okay guys, my most recent update reorganized the code for 
initializing the system state from user input. You can 
test the program by compiling with: 

gcc -ansi -Wall main.c matrix.c init_state.c -o test

Then, you can run the program to test it with: 

./test 

This initializes all of the data structures relevant to the 
algorithm which are defined as global data in main.c

This is a really good start, and I hope to get us running
with a decent safety algorithm soon. 

I added your guys names in the description of the 
init_state.c program so that you get credit for writing
the code as it was before I reorganized it.
