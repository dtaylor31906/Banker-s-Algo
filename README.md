# Banker-s-Algo

# Most Recent Update! (from Jason)

Guys, 

The project is complete! The program runs and does exactly what it's
supposed to do. So, now we just need to work on our presentation
and on our analysis. As far as code goes, we're good to go.

To test the program as it is now run the following commands: 

make
./banker

This will run the program. You'll see that I went ahead and 
improved the user interface. 

Have a good break! 
Jason
